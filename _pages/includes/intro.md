# 😊 About me
Hello! 
I am Cuiying Huo, an Assistant Professor at Tianjin University. In January 2025, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. [Di Jin (金弟)](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/jindi/index.htm). From October 2023 to October 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by Prof. [Gao Cong (丛高)](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/). Since graduation, I have been conducting postdoctoral research under the supervision of Prof. [Wenhuan Lu (路文焕)](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/whlu/index.html), with close academic guidance from Prof. [Jianguo Wei (魏建国)](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/weijianguo/index.html). My research interests include graph machine learning, graph neural networks, complex network analysis, and their applications.
