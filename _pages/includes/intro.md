In January 2025, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Tianjin University, supervised by Prof. [Di Jin (金弟)](https://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/jindi/index.htm). From October 2023 to October 2024, I was a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by Prof. [Gao Cong (丛高)](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/gaocong/). Prior to that, I obtained my B.S. degree from Yanshan University in 2019.

My research interests include graph machine learning, graph neural networks, complex network analysis, and their applications.
